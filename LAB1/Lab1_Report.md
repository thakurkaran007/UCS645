### Observation

- π correct; scales with threads.
- task-clock 442.20 ms.
- page-faults 95; context-switches 8.

### Perf interpretation

- **Purpose:** perf measures hardware and software events (task-clock, cycles, instructions, branches, context-switches, page-faults, user/sys times).
- **PMU error:** 'cpu_core' not supported; use standard events (e.g., `cycles,instructions,cache-misses`) or enable kernel/PMU support.
- **Task-clock:** approximates CPU-time across threads (higher -> more CPU usage).
- **Context-switches / cpu-migrations:** indicate scheduler overhead; high values affect timing stability.
- **Page-faults:** indicate memory-related overhead; many page faults suggest memory pressure.
- **User / Sys times:** show time in user/kernel; compare with wall time to find blocking or I/O impact.
- **Recommendations:** run multiple trials, increase problem size for stable counters, pin threads (`taskset`) to reduce scheduling noise, and use supported perf events.
